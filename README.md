## üè† Student Accommodation Management System (Final Project)

For my final project, I developed a **Student Accommodation Management System** using Spring Boot and related technologies.

### Description

This application helps students find and manage accommodations while allowing admins to manage listings and user activities.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**  
  - Built RESTful services with no XML configurations.
  - Maintained layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository).

- **Spring Security (JWT)**  
  - Implemented token-based authentication (JWT).
  - Defined user roles (ADMIN and USER).
  - Configured CORS for secure API access.

- **Spring AOP**  
  - Created logs for accessing controllers, services, and repositories.
  - Logs include username, accessed methods, timestamps.
  - All logs stored in `application.log`.

- **Spring JDBC**  
  - Used Spring JDBC for all database interactions.

- **Version Control**  
  - Managed the project in a private GitHub repository.
  - Followed consistent commit practices (at least 25 commits).

### Core Features & APIs

- **Authentication & User Management:**
  - User Registration & Login
  - Password change and password recovery
